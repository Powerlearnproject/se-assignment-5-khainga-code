9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) offers powerful debugging capabilities that support a variety of programming languages. Here's how to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code, along with some key debugging features.

Setting Up Debugging
Open Your Project:

Open the folder containing your project in VS Code by going to File > Open Folder... and selecting your project folder.
Create a Simple Program:

For this example, let's create a simple JavaScript program. Create a new file named app.js and add the following code:
javascript
Copy code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

let result = add(2, 3);
console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
Configure the Debugger:

Click on the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (or press Ctrl+Shift+D on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Shift+D on macOS).
Click on create a launch.json file in the Run and Debug panel to create a debug configuration file.
Select the environment you are working with. For this example, select Node.js to debug the JavaScript program.
A launch.json file will be created in a new .vscode folder within your project directory with the following content:
json
Copy code
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
        }
    ]
}
Set Breakpoints:

Open the app.js file.
Click on the gutter (the area to the left of the line numbers) next to the line of code where you want to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear, indicating a breakpoint.
Starting the Debugging Session
Start Debugging:
In the Run and Debug panel, click on the green play button next to Launch Program to start debugging.
The program will run, and execution will pause at any breakpoints you have set.
Key Debugging Features
Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.
Conditional breakpoints can be set by right-clicking on a breakpoint and selecting Edit Breakpoint, then adding a condition.
Watch Variables:

Add variables to the Watch panel to monitor their values as you step through your code.
Click on the + icon in the Watch panel and enter the variable name you want to watch.
Call Stack:

View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in the program.
The Call Stack panel shows all active function calls at the point where the breakpoint is hit.
Step Controls:

Use the step controls in the Debug toolbar to navigate through your code:
Continue (F5): Resume program execution until the next breakpoint.
Step Over (F10): Execute the next line of code, but do not step into functions.
Step Into (F11): Step into the function call at the current line.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Step out of the current function and return to the caller.
Variable Inspection:

Hover over variables in the editor to see their current values.
The Variables panel shows the local variables and their values at the current point in execution.
Console Output:

The Debug Console shows output from console.log statements and other standard output.
You can also execute code snippets in the Debug Console to inspect variables or test code during a debugging session.
10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
